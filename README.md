# hackthebubble-2021
"Hack the Bubble" 2021 - an arcade-themed, 12-hour hackathon arranged by STACS (St Andrews Computing Soceity).

The initial idea was to implement an AI making use of Reinforcement Learning (Deep Q-learning) to learn how to play tetris and beat it. After suffering numerous problems with this side of the project, we just decided to write a few arcade games. 

Done in Python 3.8, making use of the `pygame` module. See [here](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/) for a good example.
